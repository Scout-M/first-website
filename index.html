          Hello! My name is Amy and I am a software engineering student at
          Flatiron. Before jumping into the word of programming, I was in
          Education. I taught in both formal and informal educational settings.
          I enjoy hiking, travel, learning languages, and nature. I love animals
          and currently have two cats, Sophie and Gus. Growing up near the coast
          instilled a love for the ocean, though not a love for swimming. I
          enjoy being on the water, not in it. I have studied Danish and German.
          I plan to switch from Germanic languages to Romance languages by
          learning Spanish. Right now, however I am concentrating on
          programming. I am learning and working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
          This website is my very fisrt project for the Software Engineering
          Bootcamp.

          Working at Georgia Aquarium was an amazing experience. I primarily
          wrote educational progrmas for preK to 2nd Grade, but taught progrmas
          through High School. On my morning walk to the office, I passed
          penguins and sharks. I learned a lot about marine animals and
          discovered a passion for sharks. Sharks are incredible creatures.
          Unfortunately 470 species of shark are on the endangered list. Depsite
          their intimidating size, both Great Whites and Whale Sharks are some
          of the most vulnerable. Understandably, most people fear sharks, but
          did you know that cows kill more people a year than sharks?

          I was a lead Montessori teacher at White Flint Children's House. My
          responsibilities included detailed record keeping of each child's
          progress, parent communication, and making sure everyone had fun.
          Being a part of a child's early years was an incredible experience and
          I am lucky to have been a part of this school. White Flint Children's
          House has a strong sense of community and celebrates both our
          similarities and differences. I was also an administrative assistant
          and helped maintain student records.
