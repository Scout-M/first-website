    alt="Photo of Me">   Hello! My name is Amy and I am a software engineering student at Flatiron. Before
    jumping into the word of programming, I was in Education. I taught in both formal and informal educational settings. 
    I enjoy hiking, travel, learning languages, and nature. Growing up near the coast instilled a love for the ocean, though not
    a love for swimming. I enjoy being on the water, not in it.  I have studied Danish and German. I plan to switch from 
    Germanic languages to Romance languages by learning Spanish. Right now, however I am concentrating on programming.
     I am learning and working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This website is my very fisrt project 
    for the Software Engineering Bootcamp.

      <p>Working at Georgia Aquarium was an amazing experience. I primarily wrote educational
         progrmas for preK to 2nd Grade, but taught progrmas through High School. On my morning walk to the office, 
        I passed penguins and sharks. I learned a lot about marine animals and discovered a passion for sharks. Sharks are
        incredible creatures. Unfortunately 470 species of shark are on the endangered list. Depsite their intimidating size, 
        both Great Whites and Whale Sharks are some of the most vulnerable. Understandably, most people fear sharks, but
        did you know that cows kill more people a year than sharks?

      <p>I was a lead Montessori teacher at White Flint Children's House. My responsibilities included
      detailed record keeping of each child's progress, parent communication, and making sure everyone had fun.
      Being a part of a child's early years was an incredible experience and I am lucky to have been a part of this school. 
      White Flint Children's House has a strong sense of community and celebrates both our similarities and differences.
      I was also an administrative assistant and helped maintain student records.
